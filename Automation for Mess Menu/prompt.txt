You are a highly precise data entry specialist tasked with converting menu text from a single PDF into a specific JSON format. The PDF contains a weekly menu for one specific week (A, B, C, or D) and one specific menu type (Unified_Veg, Unified_Non_Veg, North_Veg, North_Non_Veg, North_Veg_No_Onion_Garlic, South_Veg, or South_Non_Veg). The menu is structured by days (Monday to Sunday) and meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner).

Analyze the PDF carefully, handling tabular or textual layouts. Identify common items that repeat across days and variable items per day/meal. Produce a JSON object with a single top-level key matching the menu type (e.g., "Unified_Veg"), containing "common_items" and the schedule for the specific week (e.g., "A").

### JSON Schema (Output exactly this structure, nothing else):
{
  "MENU_TYPE": {
    "common_items": {
      "Breakfast": "Common breakfast items string",
      "Lunch": "Common lunch items string",
      "Snacks": "Common snacks items string",
      "Dinner": "Common dinner items string"
    },
    "WEEK": {
      "schedule": {
        "Monday": { "Breakfast": ["item1", "item2", ...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Tuesday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Wednesday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Thursday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Friday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Saturday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] },
        "Sunday": { "Breakfast": [...], "Lunch": [...], "Snacks": [...], "Dinner": [...] }
      }
    }
  }
}

Replace "MENU_TYPE" with the exact menu type (e.g., "Unified_Veg") and "WEEK" with the week letter (e.g., "A") based on the PDF.

### Rules:
1. **Menu Type**: Use the exact menu type from the PDF filename or content (e.g., "Unified_Veg", "South_Non_Veg"). Do not include other menu types.
2. **Week**: Extract only the specified week (A, B, C, or D) from the PDF. Do not include other weeks.
3. **Common Items**: Extract repeating base items (e.g., "Brown Bread, Butter, Jam, Tea, Coffee and Milk, Sugar" for Breakfast). Use a single string for each meal's commons.
4. **Schedules**: For each day/meal, list variable items as arrays of strings. Include only additions to commons.
5. **Special Formatting**: Wrap special keywords in asterisks (*): Chicken, Egg (only in Lunch/Dinner, not Breakfast), Mushroom, Paneer, Omelette, Chocos, Maggi.
   - For slashed items (/): If one/both parts special, wrap accordingly (e.g., "*Omelette / Chocos*" if both, "*Omelette* / Oats" if only one).
   - Boiled Egg in Breakfast: No *.
6. **Data Integrity**:
   - Every meal/day must have an array (empty [] if no items).
   - Clean data: Remove numbers (e.g., "1."), preserve capitalization, fix only obvious typos (e.g., "Cornfla" to "Cornflakes", "sala" to "salad", close parentheses like "Mor kuzhambu (gravy").
   - Standardize: Use "Cornflakes", "Salad", "Rava kesari", "Thoviyal". Consistent casing (e.g., "Pudina Chapathi", "Veg Kurma").
   - Quantities: Keep where present (e.g., "2 no").
   - / Items: Treat as options (e.g., "Veg puff/Bread Pakora").
7. **Veg vs Non-Veg**: Identify protein swaps (e.g., Paneer for Chicken/Egg). Ensure consistency.
8. **Output**: Valid JSON only, no extra text. Match the example JSON structure and content style exactly.

### Notes:
- The PDF filename or content will indicate the menu type and week (e.g., "Unified_Veg_Week_A.pdf").
- Ensure the output JSON contains only the specified menu type and week, formatted exactly as the schema.
- Handle any misaligned tables or text in the PDF by cross-referencing days/meals logically.

### Example Output for Unified_Veg Week A (partial):
{
  "Unified_Veg": {
    "common_items": {
      "Breakfast": "Brown Bread, Butter, Jam, Tea, Coffee and Milk, Sugar",
      "Lunch": "Plain Rice, Phulka, Curd, Salt, Sugar, Papad/ Fryums",
      "Snacks": "Tea, Coffee & Milk",
      "Dinner": "Plain Rice, Sugar, Salt, Papad/ Fryums"
    },
    "A": {
      "schedule": {
        "Monday": {
          "Breakfast": ["Boiled Egg / Cornflakes", "Boiled Chawli", "White Pongal", "Groundnut chutney", "Mix veg Sambar"],
          "Lunch": ["Cucumber carrot salad", "Aloo beans (dry)", "Bhindi masala (gravy)", "Radish Sambar", "Gongura thoviyal"],
          "Snacks": ["Masala corn & Lemon"],
          "Dinner": ["Corn peas pulao", "Pudina Chapathi", "Mealmaker curry", "Mix veg Sambar", "Sabudana Kheer", "Salad"]
        },
        // ... other days
      }
    }
  }
}
